**What is the purpose of this indicator?**

This indicator does two things. First, it is a more easy-to-read Bollinger Band indicator that allows traders to easily see expansions and contractions in volatility utilizing a color gradient. Second, utilizing moving averages and a zero line allows the trader to easily see which phase in the volatility the asset is in. Volatility always moves through expanding and contracting phases.

In short, the indicator goal is to help traders spot when the volatility for an asset is going to expand (more explosive/strong price movements) or contract (more calm/weak price movements)

**How does it work?**

This indicator utilizes Bollinger Bands to create a more visual representation of volatility using a color gradient.
The indicator takes the top band and lower band of the Bollinger Bands and assigns them a value.
Using this value a color assignment is made to identify an expanding or contraction period in the volatility.
To tell when the volatility is expanding the bands will change from orange to purple.
When the volatility is contracting the bands will be blue.

The zero line in the indicator separates the volatility periods. The contraction period is below the zero line. Expanding periods are above the zero line.

**How do you trade with this indicator?**

This indicator should be used in a broader trading system. You should enter trades when the volatility is low and indicated blue for better chances at executing successful trades.
